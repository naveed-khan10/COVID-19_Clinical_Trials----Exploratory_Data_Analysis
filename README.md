# COVID-19 Clinical Trials -- Exploratory Data Analysis
 This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset related to COVID-19 clinical trials. The analysis aims to uncover insights from the dataset, which consists of 5783 clinical trials with various attributes, including trial status, conditions, interventions, and enrollment numbers.

 # Key Analyses Performed:
## Dataset Exploration:

# Shape and Columns: 
Analyzed the dataset's structure by examining its shape and listing the column names.
# Head/Tail: 
Retrieved the first and last 5, 15, and 30 rows to get an initial understanding of the data.
# Data Types and Summary Statistics:

# Data Types:
Explored the data types of each column to understand the nature of the data (e.g., textual, numerical).
# Statistical Summary:
Applied summary statistics to key numerical columns, such as 'Rank' and 'Enrollment', and documented key insights.
# Data Selection Using loc and iloc:

Retrieved specific columns and rows based on certain conditions, such as selecting all columns for the first clinical trial, retrieving the title and status of a specific trial, and finding trials that are currently recruiting.
# Missing Values Analysis:

Identified and analyzed missing values across the dataset, highlighting columns with significant missing data.
# Duplicate Rows:

Determined the number of duplicate rows in the dataset and calculated the sum of duplicates.
# Conditional Analysis:

Answered specific questions using conditional statements, such as the number of studies with enrollment greater than a threshold, the number of trials with 'No Results Available', and the number of trials that started after January 1, 2020.
# Conclusion:
This EDA provides a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 clinical trials dataset, revealing key trends and insights that can be further explored in subsequent analyses. The repository is structured to guide users through the various steps of the analysis, from initial exploration to more advanced data manipulation techniques.
